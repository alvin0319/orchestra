# orchestra
A (WIP) lightweight music bot for Discord written in Kotlin.

## Features
Since this bot aims to provide a lightweight experience, it only has a few features.

* Play music from YouTube, Soundcloud, Bandcamp, Vimeo, Twitch, Mixer, and any HTTP stream
* Slash Command Support
* Docker Support (TODO)
